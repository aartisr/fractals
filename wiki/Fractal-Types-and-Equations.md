# Fractal Types and Mathematical Equations

This document provides a brief description and the mathematical equation for each fractal type available in the Fractal Workspace application.

## Mandelbrot Set

**Description:**
The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers $c$ for which the sequence $z_{n+1} = z_n^p + c$ (with $z_0 = 0$ and $p$ usually 2) does not diverge to infinity.

**Equation:**

$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^p + c
$$

## Julia Set

**Description:**
The Julia set is generated by iterating $z_{n+1} = z_n^p + c$ for each point $z_0$ in the complex plane, with a fixed complex parameter $c$.

**Equation:**

$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^p + c
$$

## Burning Ship Fractal

**Description:**
The Burning Ship fractal is similar to the Mandelbrot set, but uses the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts at each iteration.

**Equation:**

$$
z_{n+1} = (|\Re(z_n)| + i|\Im(z_n)|)^2 + c
$$

## Newton Fractal

**Description:**
The Newton fractal visualizes the basins of attraction for Newton's method applied to a polynomial equation, typically $f(z) = z^3 - 1$.

**Equation:**

$$
z_{n+1} = z_n - \frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)}
$$

## Barnsley Fern

**Description:**
The Barnsley Fern is a fractal created using an iterated function system (IFS) with four affine transformations, producing a shape resembling a fern leaf.

**Equations:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_1(x, y) &= (0, 0.16y) \\
    f_2(x, y) &= (0.85x + 0.04y, -0.04x + 0.85y + 1.6) \\
    f_3(x, y) &= (0.2x - 0.26y, 0.23x + 0.22y + 1.6) \\
    f_4(x, y) &= (-0.15x + 0.28y, 0.26x + 0.24y + 0.44)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Sierpinski Triangle

**Description:**
The Sierpinski Triangle is a self-similar fractal formed by recursively removing equilateral triangles from a larger triangle.

**Construction Rule:**


**No single equation, but the process is defined recursively.**
